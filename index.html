		<h3>Imprint</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://imprint.us" target="_blank">Imprint</a>
			is a platform for making a collaborative gift. If someone you love has a big event coming up (think birthday, graduation, anniversary), you would invite everyone who loves them to contribute messages, photos, and videos. Imprint does all the work to corral everyone, makes it easy to add content, and creates a beautiful digital scrapbook to give to your loved one. And it's free!
		</p>
		<h3>My Role</h3>
		<p>
			I've been with Imprint for 2+ years, since it was just me and the CEO working out of her dining room. I've learned how to be a scrappy, pivoting start-up and how to iterate your product. I'm responsible for launching our product through digital marketing efforts last winter, and getting us to about 200 new users each week. As product manager, I'm responsible for taking all the inputs (customer feedback, QA, user research) and turning them into outputs (new features and iterations of our product).
